# Hangman Project

A simple Java app for creating text files representing fictional characters. Uses a very small homebrew system I made. 

A character has the following:
- Name
- Gender
- Age
- Species
- Alignment
- Description
- 6 Stats: STRENGTH, PERCEPTION, CONSTITUTION, MAGIC POTENTIAL, AGILITY, WILLPOWER
- Character powers categorized as Talents and Techniques. These have a name, rank (E->A and S) and a description.
- An Other Description

All of these fields are reflected in a simple GUI that the user can interact with. They can input content into these fields, then save their data as a text file. 
Loading a character text file into the app is planned for the future.
